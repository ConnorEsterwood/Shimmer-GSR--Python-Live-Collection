# Shimmer-GSR--Python-Live-Collection
A way to get the live shimmer data from the shimmer gsr+ for HR and GSR into python3 and reading on the fly.

This is a small script that will allow you to use the Shimmer GSR+ device with python to live read data from the device into python. 

I will not maintain this script but throught I would share it as a reproduction of the original script developed by Shimmer's own group as this version is updated for Python3 and works as of 04/20/21
